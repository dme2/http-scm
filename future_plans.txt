the main function of the web program should be 
	1. Launch the website at the address and port
	2. Cycle through the list of routes until the route matches the path
		3. if no patch matching rout, give a 404
	
Each get route should return a string of html information

We should format the html info via pre defined templates for the data
	i.e.: Given a certain kind of data, return a formatted piece of HTML w/ the data
		e.g. (let x sql get data where ...) -> (format x) -> "<div> [data] <\div>"	

so our library deals mainly with: 
	routes and rules and html generated from these rules

app-main : "host":str, port:int, (routes): list, default_404?:bool

	e.g. (app-main "local-host" 8080 (routes))

def-route-get : "html-str" : utf8-encoded string

	e.g. (def-route-get (html (gen_template (data))))
