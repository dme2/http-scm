a very small http server with routing named after my cat

need to add:
	[x] a new routing function
	[?] simple html page generation (new project)
todo:
    [x] fix httpserver - add router functionality
    [x] make router module
    [x] test httpserver
    [x] append file types dynamically
    [] get address/port from user input
	[] why is the server so slow for mobile requests? Is the socket being blocked for ~15s while reading?
