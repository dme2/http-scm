move towards an event driven implementation:
	 poll for requests and respond accordingly
	 e.g. for requests

following darkhttpd's implementation:
	1. initialize connection (set for recv)
	2. start server loop (while (loopvar==1) (serve))
	3. poll connections for conns thatneed attention
	   		a. Check using FD_ISSET (socket-receive-ready? in scheme)
	   		b. accept_connection if we have data waiting
			   (fill connection_list, set state)
	4. poll for a recv request
	5. change state from recv to send header
	6. send header
	7. change state from send_header to send_reply
	8. send reply
	9. change state to done
